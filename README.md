# Connect Four Bot

## Introduction
This project presents an implementation of the game "Connect Four", including an intelligent Connect Four Bot. This was done by making use of the minimax algorithm, alongside alpha-beta pruning. A transposition table was also used to enable lookup of previously calculated states, improving the speed of the bot.
